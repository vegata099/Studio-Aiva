## What is Studio AIVA?

**Studio AIVA** is a professional platform designed to bring character models to life.

It bridges **visual models** and **artificial intelligence**, allowing creators and developers to build:
- Interactive characters
- AI-driven avatars
- Expressive, reactive experiences
- Real-time model-based interfaces

Models are no longer static assets — they become **living systems**.

---

## Core Capabilities

### Model Integration
- Support for **2D, 3D, and experimental model formats**
- Clean pipelines for importing and managing models
- Studio-grade presentation and control

### Intelligence & AI Routing
- Public AI API routing
- Provider-agnostic architecture
- Real-time AI responses bound directly to models

### Expressions & Behavior
- Expression control systems
- Idle and reactive motion
- Behavior layers that give models personality

### Interaction
- Embedded chat interfaces
- Voice-ready architecture *(planned)*
- Model-driven responses instead of static UI

### Studio Environment
- Test and preview models in real time
- Iterate on expressions, behaviors, and routing
- Built for experimentation and production workflows

---

## Use Cases

- AI-powered avatars and VTubers  
- Interactive NPCs and companions  
- Visual frontends for LLMs  
- Creative tools and AI experiments  
- Research into embodied AI systems  

---

## Architecture Overview

Studio AIVA follows a modular, creator-first architecture:

- **Model Layer** — 2D / 3D / Hybrid characters  
- **Expression Layer** — motion, state, emotion  
- **AI Routing Layer** — public AI providers  
- **Interaction Layer** — chat, events, (voice planned)  

Each layer is designed to be flexible, scalable, and non-destructive to the others.

---

## Roadmap (High-Level)

- Advanced expression presets  
- Voice input and output  
- Scene-based model orchestration  
- Multiplayer / shared sessions  
- Plugin system for behaviors  
- Public SDK and API documentation  

---

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is being developed alongside the platform, covering:
- Core concepts
- Studio workflows
- AI routing
- Best practices for building intelligent models
